# HoroscopesCLI

This CLI was created to show daily horoscopes for all of the signs. The horoscopes come from www.horoscope.com. If you're unsure of your sign, you can find out using the CLI by inputting your birthday. You can hear your general daily horoscope, your love horoscope, or both. You can check your friends' horoscopes too.
